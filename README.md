#### goal
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```
#### challenges
The main struggle i had with this homework was working with heroku and having the file structure be compatible. 
#### how it runs
You will arrive on a landing page. You can click the button on the landing page to take you to notes.html. From there you can add notes and save them. 
#### future
in the future the delete would be functional
